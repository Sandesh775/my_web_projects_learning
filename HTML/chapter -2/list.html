        <dt>C programming</dt>
        <dd>C is a powerful, general-purpose programming language that provides low-level access to memory and is widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt>Python programming</dt>
        <dd>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.</dd>
        <br>
        <dt>Javascript</dt>
        <dd>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used for adding interactivity to web pages. It follows the ECMAScript standard and supports multiple paradigms, including object-oriented, functional, and event-driven programming.</dd>
<br>
        <dt>Java</dt>
        <dd>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its platform independence ("Write Once, Run Anywhere"). It is widely used for web applications, mobile development (Android), enterprise software, and backend systems.</dd>
<br>
        <dt>Rust</dt>
        <dd>Rust is a high-performance, memory-safe programming language designed for system programming, concurrency, and safety without a garbage collector. It emphasizes ownership, borrowing, and zero-cost abstractions, making it ideal for performance-critical applications.</dd>
<br>
        <dt>C++</dt>
        <dd>C++ is a high-performance, general-purpose programming language that extends C with object-oriented, generic, and functional programming features. It is widely used in system programming, game development, and high-performance applications.</dd>
